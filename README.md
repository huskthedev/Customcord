<details>
<summary>Does CustomCord violate Discord's Terms of Service?</summary>

Yes. Like any client modification, CustomCord technically violates Discord’s Terms of Service.

That said, just like Vencord and other mods, **there are no known reports of bans** purely for using CustomCord — as long as you **avoid abusive plugins** or violating server rules.

> Use at your own risk. If you rely heavily on your Discord account (e.g., for work or moderation), consider staying on the official client.

To stay safe:

* Don’t use malicious or spammy plugins.
* Avoid showing CustomCord in screenshots on public Discord servers.
